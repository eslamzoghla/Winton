# Winton
Freelanceing website

# Abstract
Freelancing is a contract-based profession where you use your skills, education, and experience to work with many clients and take on different tasks. Freelancing usually includes jobs that allow you to work from home. It is just that many of the jobs performed by freelancers can be delivered online without being in the company's or client's place to increase income and avoid any disasters in the world such as the coronavirus that turned the world upside down.
Winton website acts as a link between the freelancer and the client and facilitates communication between them, and it is easy to use and helps the client to follow up on the previous work of the freelancer, and if he sees that he meets his needs, he begins to communicate with him, or the client writes a publication with all his needs and determines the time and the required price, and the freelancers begin to communicate with him.
One of the most important advantages of Winton instead of working for one full-time employer and getting a fixed salary in return, he has many clients according to his terms and price, because he believes that his work is worthy. 
Once the freelancer has determined the services they will provide, Winton allows them to share a collection of previous works, depending on their own skill, so that customers begin to communicate with him to implement their need and as the beauty of his work increases, more projects will come to him, for example, in terms of designing independent drawings, this may come in the form of images you have developed, and perhaps some pieces of art, as well as samples of previous works.
